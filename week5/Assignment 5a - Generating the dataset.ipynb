    "<h3>About the assignment</h3>\n",
    "<p>In this assignment we will generate the dataset from the simulation we coded last week. You will be changing a minor section of the code to record some data and then we will convert it into a dataframe using pandas which we will then save in a csv format. In 5b we will use some plots and graphs to get a better look and understanding of our data. Worth noting is that there is a lot of data that can be extracted from this simulation. Both the trends of the general status of the society with people being sick, dead, healthy etc which could could be considered one type of valuable data, another could be several different datasets of each person, how long they have been sick and their daily actions. Of course remember that we currently have a very simplified scenario and yet there is so much interesting data to extract, isn't that just brilliant? </p>\n",

    "<p>Below is the slightly modified solution proposal from last week. I have made a few artistic changes in terms of how the print statement looks and added a variable for people_susceptible. Also I have rewritten and added another variable called people_immune which increments when either a person is vaccinated, recovered or both (Check the advance days method for this change). As in last weeks assignment you will find instructions for the assignment below all the code. Worth noting is that this is the last you will see of the huge file, next assignment is just about working with a dataframe in pandas, as we did in week 3 but with the addition of introducing plots. </p>"

    "This assignment is divided into two sections; the first section is about creating a data array which is done in the start_simulation method,the second section is about converting this data array into a dataframe and then saving it in a csv format. Although a lot of data can be extracted from this scenario, we will focus on extracting the day by day progress of the village. The dataset will thus contain a record of each day with the amount of people sick, recovered, deceased, vaccinated, immune and susceptible. Lets start by creating this data array.\n",
    "<h4>3.1 Generating the data array </h4>\n",
    "<p>Creating the data array is both a bit tedious but also fairly simple. To generate the data array we will be making use of both numpy and regular python lists. Appending and incrementing sizes of numpy arrays are very expensive in terms of computational cost, thus we will use a regular two-dimensional python list at first, and then convert it into a numpy array.  We do not need to save each day as it kind of comes naturally with the format, since each row represents a day and the very first row represents the first day. </p>\n",

    "    <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">After the part where you create the day_data variable, append the day_data variable to the day_data_list variable we created at the start of the method, if you want to validate that the the day_data variable corresponds correctly to the print statements generated when you run the program, you can use another print statement to display the list. </li>\n",
    "        <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">Once again perform the two steps described above but this time do it inside the while-loop sticking with the same format as how we did it above the while loop</li>\n",
    "        <li style=\"padding-bottom: 16px;\">Finally, after the while loop create a variable day_data_array which should be a numpy array using the day_data_list variable we created.</li>\n",
